# Tatha Castles
The Tatha Castles feature a strengthened defensive design and are an overhaul in terms of the economy compared to the vanilla castles. The castles were updated by Xander10alpha to be more compatible with plugins that modify the AIs behaviour.
The castles are completely reshaped and got an updated buildorder, more housing space as well as an adjsuted storage capacity to fit all necessary wares for the Vanilla AIs.
This replaces all the AI castles of the Vanilla AIs in their respective order.
